GPU Particle Simulator — Technical Notes

This project implements a 2D particle simulator where all physics is executed
on the GPU using OpenGL compute shaders (GL 4.3+). The CPU is used only for
initialization, buffer management, input handling, and dispatching compute
work.

Particle data is stored in Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs) containing:
- position (vec2)
- velocity (vec2)
- particle type (int)

To avoid O(N^2) all-pairs interaction costs, the simulator uses a uniform
spatial grid built on the GPU each frame. Each particle is assigned to a grid
cell, and interactions are limited to particles in nearby cells within a
configurable neighbor radius.

Simulation steps per frame:
1. Clear grid cell heads (GPU)
2. Build linked-cell lists via atomic operations (GPU)
3. Compute forces using neighbor-limited traversal (GPU)
4. Integrate velocity and position with damping and speed limits (GPU)
5. Render particles as point sprites (GPU)

Interaction model:
- Same-type particles apply repulsive forces
- Different-type particles apply attractive forces
- Forces are distance-based with softening to avoid singularities

The system is designed for scalability and visualization rather than physical
accuracy. Parameters such as force strength, falloff, neighbor radius, and
damping are intentionally simplified to encourage emergent behavior rather
than real-world correctness.

The recommended entry point is:
- Particles_Test_GPU_Standard.py

The premade/ directory contains alternative configurations that adjust
interaction parameters and initial conditions to produce specific visual
phenomena.

Flow GPU:
The compute shader writes positions
The vertex shader reads those same positions
The fragment shader outputs these positions

Vertex shader = “particle → sprite”
Fragment shader = “sprite → pixels”
